# Plasma Activated Water (PAW)

Plasma Activated Water (PAW) is water that has been treated with a non-thermal plasma, resulting in the infusion of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

These reactive species have very specific reaction and signaling mechanisms on a variety of biological systems that improve plant vitality.

## Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)

**Function:** Acts as a disinfectant, killing pathogens on plants and in soil.  
**Impact:** Reduces the need for chemical pesticides, promoting healthier plants.

## Ozone (O₃)

**Function:** Strong oxidizing agent that breaks down harmful organic compounds and pathogens.  
**Impact:** Enhances soil health and reduces disease prevalence.

## Hydroxyl Radicals (•OH)

**Function:** Extremely reactive species that degrade organic pollutants and pathogens.  
**Impact:** Cleanses water and soil, ensuring a healthier growing environment.

## Nitrites (NO₂⁻) and Nitrates (NO₃⁻)

**Function:** Serve as essential nutrients for plants, facilitating growth and development.  
**Impact:** Enhances nutrient availability and uptake, leading to stronger, healthier plants.

## Peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻)

**Function:** Combines the properties of ROS and RNS, acting as a disinfectant and growth enhancer.  
**Impact:** Provides dual benefits of pathogen control and nutrient enrichment.

## Nitric Oxide (NO)

**Function:** Regulates plant physiological processes, including stress responses and growth.  
**Impact:** Improves plant resilience and productivity.
