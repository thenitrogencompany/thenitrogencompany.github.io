## Abstract
This study demonstrates that plasma-fixed nitrogen (PFN), used as an inorganic biostimulant, significantly improves marketable yields of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. longifolia) by 250% compared to conventional methods, despite using just one-tenth of the nitrogen fertilizer. Generated by dielectric barrier discharge over water, PFN enhances the field holding capacity of lettuce, promoting better root growth and nutrient uptake, reducing environmental impact, and offering a sustainable alternative to traditional nitrogen fertilizers.

## Abstract
This study explores the use of plasma-fixated nitrogen, which produces nitrates in water, as a nitrogen fertilizer for turf grass like rye grass and bent grass. Experiments showed that grass treated with plasma-fixated nitrogen had improved growth compared to those treated with sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate. Adding phosphorus and potassium to the plasma-fixated nitrogen further enhanced grass growth, highlighting its potential as a sustainable fertilizer alternative.
